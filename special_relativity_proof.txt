Theory of Special Relativity

Postulates of Special Relativity:
1. The Principle of Relativity: The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference.
2. The Constancy of the Speed of Light: The speed of light in a vacuum is constant for all observers, regardless of the motion of the light source or the observer.

Lorentz Transformations:
Given two inertial frames S and S', where S' is moving at velocity v relative to S along the x-axis:
t' = γ (t - vx/c^2)
x' = γ (x - vt)
y' = y
z' = z
where γ = 1/√(1 - v^2/c^2).

Time Dilation:
Consider a light clock in S', which ticks every time a light pulse travels from one mirror to the other and back. In the frame S, the light travels a longer, diagonal path.
In S' (rest frame of the clock):
t' = 2L/c
In S (moving frame):
t = 2D/c
where D = √(L^2 + (vt/2)^2).
From the invariance of the speed of light:
c^2 t^2 = 4L^2 + v^2 t^2
c^2 t^2 - v^2 t^2 = 4L^2
t^2 (c^2 - v^2) = 4L^2
t = 2L/√(c^2 - v^2) = 2L/c * 1/√(1 - v^2/c^2)
t = t' * γ
Thus, t = γ t', demonstrating time dilation.

Length Contraction:
Consider a rod of length L' at rest in S'. In S, the rod is moving with velocity v.
Proper length in S':
L' = x_2' - x_1'
Observed length in S:
L = x_2 - x_1
Using Lorentz transformations:
x_2' = γ (x_2 - vt)
x_1' = γ (x_1 - vt)
At the same time t in S:
L' = γ (x_2 - x_1)
L' = γ L
L = L'/γ
Thus, L = L'/γ, demonstrating length contraction.

Relativity of Simultaneity:
Consider two events occurring at the same time t in S, but at different positions x_1 and x_2.
Using Lorentz transformations:
t_1' = γ (t - vx_1/c^2)
t_2' = γ (t - vx_2/c^2)
For x_1 ≠ x_2:
t_1' ≠ t_2'
Thus, simultaneity is relative, and events that are simultaneous in one frame are not necessarily simultaneous in another.

Mass-Energy Equivalence:
Starting from the work-energy theorem and relativistic momentum, consider a particle with energy E and momentum p:
E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2
For a particle at rest p = 0:
E = mc^2
Thus, E = mc^2, demonstrating mass-energy equivalence.
